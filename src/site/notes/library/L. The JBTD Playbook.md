	- [[A|A]] The five elements are:
		- **Job Performer** - who executes the job
		- **Job** - what they want to accomplish
		- **Process** - how the job will get done
		- **Needs** - why the performer is doing the job
		- **Circumstances** - when/where the job needs to get done

	- [[A|A]] **Verb + Object + Clarifier** (e.g. visit family on special occasions, listen to music on the run, charge mobile phone on the go)
- [[pages/Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]] [[Q|Q]] How to define jobs to be done?
  collapsed:: true
	- Jobs should have a clear end state and be expresses in functional terms (e.g., prepare a meal)
	- Jobs should be independent of the solution, timeless and as stable (unchanging) as possible.
		- Ask yourself, "*How would people have gotten the job done 50 years ago?*"
	- Don't include adjectives like quick, easy, or inexpensive. They indicate metrics in which end-users compare solutions or needs.
- [[pages/Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]][[Q|Q]] What are three types of jobs?
  collapsed:: true
	- [[A|A]] **The main job** (_grow retirement portfolio_), **related jobs** (_balance cashflow_), **emotional/social jobs** (_feel in control of savings/be perceived as competent with savings_)
- [[pages/Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]] [[Q|Q]]What are **related jobs** and why they matter?
  collapsed:: true
	- Related jobs are other jobs connected to the main job that the performer wants to accomplish, but significant different so they don't look like sub-jobs or stages of the main job.
	- They help you understand the overall landscape of objectives.
	  collapsed:: true
		- >As you define the main job, identify related jobs to understand the overall landscape of objectives. Only then should you decide on a single main job to focus on, keeping related jobs in your peripheral line of sight.
		- Kalbach, Jim. The Jobs To Be Done Playbook (p. 23). Rosenfeld Media. Kindle Edition.
	- Example: If the main job is _grow retirement portfolio_, related jobs can be _finance a new home_ or _balance cash flow_
- [[pages/Atomic Notes|Atomic Notes]] Ask **Why** or **How** to identify the right level for a job.
