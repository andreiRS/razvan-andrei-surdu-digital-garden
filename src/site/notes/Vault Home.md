## Hi👋 I'm [[30-input/individuals/Razvan Andrei Surdu\|Andrei]]!

Hi, I’m Andrei 👋

I’m a software engineer and product manager, a dad, and an endurance-sports person (I’ve done an Ironman). Lately I’m learning by building with AI, using it to validate product ideas and unlock workflows like faster prototyping and automation.

This is my [[30-input/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] where I share notes, experiments, and [[30-input/Mental Models\|Mental Models]], [[tags/AI\|AI]], and [[tags/Critical Thinking\|thinking clearly]]. If any of that overlaps with your interests, feel free to explore.

If you want to discuss an idea or compare notes, message me on [Telegram](https://t.me/razvan_andrei_surdu).
