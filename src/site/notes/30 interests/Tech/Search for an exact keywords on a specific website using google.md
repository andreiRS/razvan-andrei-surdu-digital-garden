[[30 interests/Tech/Tech|Tech]]

I needed to look on oberlo blog for an article on competitors and for that the trick was to search for:

`site:https://www.oberlo.com/blog competitors`

The format is:
`sire:SITE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_TO_SEARCH KEYWORD`

Examples:
```
site:edu school
site:gov "George Washington"
site:lifewire.com OLED
site:co.uk tech
site:amazon.com "prime day"
site:nasa.gov filetype:pdf mars
site:media.defense.gov inurl:2017 report
```
