**The lesson of the black swan is that we don't know how much we don't know.**

For thousands of years, people thought that all swans were white. When someone discovered in Australia a rare black swan, he proved that the popular belief was wrong. (expectation - outlier)

Philosophers have used this story to illustrate the dangers of becoming too comfortable in what we think we know.

Examples of Black Swan events:
- World War 1
- Life of Jesus
- The Invention of Internet
