# Second-Order Thinking
[[30 input/300 other/Mental Models\|Mental Models]]


Consider secondary effects or consequences of a decision or an action, similar with when playing chess where you need to thing two, three or multiple moves ahead to gain an advantage.

This thought process plays a key role especially in areas such business strategy, policy-making and personal life choices.


## Examples

**Business Pricing Strategy**
Using basic (first-order) thinking, you might think cutting prices will sell more. But with deeper (second-order) thinking, you understand it could start a price fight with rivals, shrink profits, and make customers think the product is cheap, which could hurt sales over time

**Personal Health Decision**
You might start an intense exercise routine to quickly improve your fitness and loose weight; However, it can also lead to burnout or injury if not managed properly. A more sustainable approach that gradually increases intensity is more indicated, avoiding potential health setbacks.

## Limitations and Misinterpretations
1. Overestimating Our Ability to Predict the Future: We can be wrong in how we interpret and draw conclusions on potential outcomes
2. Analysis Paralysis: Taking too long to take action or make a decision because we are going too deep in all possible ways that a change can play out
3. Confusing it with pessimism: The goal is to have a balanced view on all potential consequences and not to focus solely on the negative outcomes.

## Questions
1. What might be second and third-order effects of this action?
2. What are possible long-term impacts of this decision?
3. What are the potential unintended consequences?
