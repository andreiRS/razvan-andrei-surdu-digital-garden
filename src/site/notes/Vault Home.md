## Hi👋 I'm [[30 input/individuals/Razvan Andrei Surdu\|Andrei]]!
I'm a software engineer on an [[40 notes/Personal Journey\|exciting journey]], transitioning from a developer role to an entrepreneur. By day, I engage in building innovative mobile games, and by night, I delve into the fascinating worlds of [[tags/AI\|AI]] and [[tags/Critical Thinking\|Critical Thinking]].

Welcome to my Digital Garden, a space where I document and share some of my learnings on this journey. If our [[30 interests\|interests]] align, I encourage you to explore and find what captures your attention. 🎁
