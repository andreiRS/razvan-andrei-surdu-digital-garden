# Critical Thinking
[[30 interests/30 interests\|30 interests]]

The human mind is a remarkable asset that shapes our potential. Unlike physical abilities, the mind's potential knows no bounds when fueled by curiosity and courage.

However, we must acknowledge that it's not the only factor at play. Physical health, emotions, and external circumstances also influence our capabilities.

Ultimately, achieving one's full potential requires a balanced synergy between the mind and body, emotional intelligence, and an understanding of the environment in which we operate. 

My goal is to provide practical guidance to help individuals thrive in this comprehensive pursuit of self-improvement.

## Mental Models
- They are frameworks for thinking that simplify complex situations, so you can reason through them easily.
- They help assess how things work and help us make better decisions.
