## Hi👋 I'm [[50 entities/51 individuals/Razvan Andrei Surdu\|Andrei]]!
- I’m a software engineer on a journey from engineer to entrepreneur.
- Welcome to my [[30 interests/Note-taking/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]], a place to share all my learnings and log my journey.
- If we share common [[30 interests/30 interests\|interests]] like [[30 interests/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneurship MOC\|Entrepreneurship]], [[30 interests/Product Management/Product Management\|Product Management]], [[30 interests/Leadership/Leadership\|Leadership]], [[30 interests/Critical Thinking/Critical Thinking\|Critical Thinking]], [[30 interests/Stoicism/Stoicism\|Stoicism]], [[30 interests/AI/AI\|AI]],  [[30 interests/Note-taking/Note-taking\|Note-taking]], and many [[30 interests/30 interests\|others]], I invite you to dig around and see what resonates with you. 🕳🐇
- There are lots of things to explore. All these notes vary in form and content, from a one-line paragraph to a small essay, with references or examples.
- If you have an idea that you would like to discuss, feel free to send me [a direct message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=25110315) , and let’s talk!
