# Critical Thinking

Your mind, over the last thousands of years, became one of the  most valuable asset that impacts your potential.

In contrast to mental labor, where the limits of your output are decided by your physical condition, the mind does not know such boundaries. It riles on your curiosity and on your courage to discover and try new things.

Here you will find tool and frameworks for your mind to help you on your own journey. 

## Mental Models
- Mental models are frameworks for thinking that simplify complex situations so you can reason through them easily.
- They help assess how things work and help us make better decisions.
