# Delegation Levels

- A visual tool created to empower self-organizing team, to make decision ownership explicit and clarify expectations between manager and team members, as early as possible.
- The levels vary from level 1 - Tell, where the manager is explicitly telling his team to execute something, to 7 - Delegate, where the team can decide without even informing the manager of the decision.
- The 7 levels are 
	- **tell** (e.g., working hours, firing a person)
	- **sell** (e.g., milestone)
	- **consult** (e.g., milestone, unity engine vs unreal engine, team format, hiring a person)
	- **agree** (e.g., team event date)
	- **advice** (e.g. architecture decision)
	- **inquire** (e.g. component architecture)
	- **delegate** (e.g., coding format)
- A manager must be careful with how many decisions need to be run through him as he quickly can become a bottleneck for his team
- A clear owner is required also for decisions that were delegated to the team (e.g., a specific individuals will make sure that coding format rules are established)
- Sometimes there are decisions that are "a tell" from outside of the team, where the entire business unit need to accept the decision
- Questions to be answered
	- How often do you review levels?
	- What are the two parties?
		- Manager and the team, what means the team agreeing, veto/majority/consens
		- Manager and an individual
