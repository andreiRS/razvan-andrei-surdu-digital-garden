## How to make reading more effective and efficient?

> [!hint]+ AI
>
> 1. Set a goal: Before reading, set a specific goal for what you want to achieve from reading the material. This will help you stay focused and engaged.
> 2. Skim-read first: Don’t dive in right away; skim-read the material first. This will help you get a sense of the structure, main ideas, and key points.
> 3. Highlight or take notes: Highlight or take notes of important information while reading. This will help you remember key points and make it easier to review later.
> 	- ⚠️ False claim: Highlighting does not help remember key points, just gives the illusion of it. Talking notes and writing it with your own words does.
> 4. Break it up: Break up the material into smaller chunks and take breaks in between. This will help prevent fatigue and increase retention.
> 5. Eliminate distractions: Eliminating distractions such as your phone or TV can improve focus and concentration while reading.
> 6. Read actively: Engage with the material by asking questions, making connections, and reflecting on what you’ve read.
> 7. Practice regularly: Reading regularly can improve your speed, comprehension, and retention over time.
> 8. Use technology tools: There are many online tools available that can help enhance your reading experience such as speed-reading apps or text-to-speech software for auditory learners.
> 	1. ❓What are some recommended tools?
> 9. Join a book club: Joining a book club can motivate you to read more frequently and provide opportunities for discussion and reflection on what you’ve read.
> 10. Enjoy it! Lastly, try to enjoy the process of reading; find topics that interest you or challenge you to keep yourself engaged and motivated!
