## Hi👋 I'm [[30-input/individuals/Razvan Andrei Surdu\|Andrei]]!
I'm a software engineer on an [[50-output/Personal Journey\|exciting journey]], transitioning from a developer role to an entrepreneur. By day, I engage in building innovative mobile games, and by night, I delve into [[tags/AI\|AI]] and [[tags/Critical Thinking\|Critical Thinking]].

This is my [[30-input/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]], a space where I share some of my notes on this journey. If our interests align, I encourage you to explore and find what captures your attention. 🎁

If you have an idea you'd like to discuss, please feel free to send me a [direct message on Telegram](https://t.me/razvan_andrei_surdu), and let's engage in a conversation!
