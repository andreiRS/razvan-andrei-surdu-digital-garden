# Mental Models

- Mental models are systems or frameworks of thinking (e.g. the concept of economies of scale, compound interest)
- They help you assess how things work and help you make better decisions.
- Knowing multiple mental models does not imply that will have solutions for any situation. However, they are strongly increasing your chances.
	- The disadvantage of a model is that it is still a model, a simplification or reduction of reality
	- This is explained by the concept "*The map is not the territory*", where to represent in all details a region, you would need a map to be the same size as the zone that it represents, making it impractical and unrealistic
- As your muscles and body are getting stronger when you are exercising at the gym, the similar thing happens with your mind when you are learning and using new mental models.
