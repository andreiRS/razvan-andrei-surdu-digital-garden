# Critical Thinking

Your mind, over the last thousands of years, developed to be one of the most valuable asset that influences your potential.

In contrast to mental labor where your physical condition decides the limit of your output, your mind does not know such boundaries. Its potential riles on your curiosity and on your courage to discover and try new things.

Here you will find tool and frameworks for your mind to help you on your own journey.

## Mental Models
- They are frameworks for thinking that simplify complex situations, so you can reason through them easily.
