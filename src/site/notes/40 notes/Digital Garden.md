# Digital Garden
[[tags/Writing\|Writing]]

Digital gardens are unique collections where you cultivate your thoughts and knowledge on various subjects. They can range from a brief paragraph to a comprehensive guide on a particular topic. Some may include simple lists of facts and instructions, while others are enriched with visual notes, mind maps, or other graphics to enhance understanding.

Think of communicating with your future self when you articulate these ideas. Each new thought you record is like planting a seed in your digital garden. Over time, as your knowledge grows, these ideas evolve and organize into what's known as an "evergreen" state.

Unlike traditional blogs, which are typically structured chronologically, digital gardens mimic a network of interconnected ideas. While there are many ways to organize your notes, it's best not to dwell too much on the structure initially. Focus instead on writing regularly, and allow the structure to emerge naturally over time.

You can get started nowadays with a plethora of options. If you want solutions out of the box, you can use [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md), [Logseq](https://logseq.com/),  [Notion](https://www.notion.so), and [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com).
