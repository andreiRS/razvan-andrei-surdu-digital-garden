- The population of Derry is 10K
- There are 95% chances that Nick is flu-free
	- Sick: 500
	- Healthy: 9500
- Nick purchases a test that has 90% accuracy.
	- Sick Positive: 450
	- Sick Negative: 50
	- Healthy Positive: 950
	- Healthy Negative: 8550
- Nick feels fine, but the test results show positive. What's the probability he's actually healthy?
	- Positive Cases = 450 + 950 = 1400
	- Healthy Positive = 950
	- The probability of being healthy out of all positives = 950 / 1400 * 100 = 68%
	  
	  ```ad-success
	  The probability of Nick to be healthy was calculated by dividing the amount of healthy positive *(the desired outcome)* to the sum of both healthy and sick positive cases *(all outcomes)*.
