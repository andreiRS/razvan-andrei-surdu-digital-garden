## Hi👋 I'm [[50 entities/51 individuals/Razvan Andrei Surdu\|Andrei]]!
I'm a software engineer on an [[20 spaces/Home/Me/Personal Roadmap\|exciting journey]], transitioning from a developer role to an entrepreneur. By day, I engage in building innovative mobile games, and by night, I delve into the fascinating worlds of [[30 interests/AI/AI\|AI]] and [[30 interests/Critical Thinking/Critical Thinking\|critical thinking]].

Welcome to my Digital Garden, a space where I document and share some of my learnings on this journey. If our [[30 interests/30 interests\|interests]] align, I encourage you to explore and find what captures your attention. 🎁

If you have an idea you'd like to discuss, please feel free to send me a [direct message on Telegram](https://t.me/razvan_andrei_surdu), and let's engage in a conversation!
