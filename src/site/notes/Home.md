## Hi👋 I'm [[50 entities/51 individuals/Razvan Andrei Surdu|Andrei]]!
- I’m a software engineer on a journey from engineer to entrepreneur.
- Welcome to my [[garden/Digital Garden|Digital Garden]], a place to share all my learnings and log my journey.
- If we share common interest like [[30 interests/Entrepreneurship/Entrepreneurship MOC|Entrepreneurship]], [[30 interests/Product Management/Product Management|Product Management]], [[30 interests/Leadership/Leadership|Leadership]], [[30 interests/Critical Thinking/Critical Thinking|Critical Thinking]], [[30 interests/Stoicism/Stoicism|Stoicism]], [[30 interests/Note-taking/Note-taking|Note-taking]], and many [[30 interests/30 interests|others]], I invite you to dig around and see what resonates with you. 🕳🐇
- There are lots of things to explore. All these notes vary in form and content, from a one-line paragraph to a small essay, with references or examples.
- If you have an idea that you would like to discuss, feel free to send me [a direct message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=25110315) , and let’s talk!
